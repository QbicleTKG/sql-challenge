# Import Instructions
The "schema" folder has two .SQL files, "queries" and "table_schemata." The "table_schemata" file should be imported into pgAdmin first. Each table should be created per the order they're in. Next, data should be imported into each table *IN THE ORDER OF TABLE CREATION,* not the order of the tables in the schema on the left side.

Once tables have been created and data imported, the "queries" file can be imported, and queries ran.
